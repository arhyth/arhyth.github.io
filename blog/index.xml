      <description>So You&amp;rsquo;re Learning a New Language [ ] Primitive types [ ] Error Handling [ ] Dependency management [ ] Async and/or Concurrency [ ] Abstraction [ ] Tooling [ ] Testing
Great! You want to learn a new language. You&amp;rsquo;re bored at work and you realize you&amp;rsquo;re current workhorse is limiting, or the stack at your new gig uses this weird esoteric stuff with too many parentheses and you hope you could understand even just some part of it.</description>

      <description>Developers are obsessed with tools. It&amp;rsquo;s our natural tendency. The capacity for toolmaking separates us from our less evolved counterparts in the biology tree &amp;ndash; the ability to build on top of the existing, to refine the crude. It&amp;rsquo;s only too easy to get too involved in the tools than in the &amp;ldquo;building up&amp;rdquo; that they should be used for.
This past year I&amp;rsquo;m glad to have reached a certain level of comfort with developer tooling that I was able to invest (I should say waste) my time learning other programming concepts, patterns and techniques.</description>

  Zen of Python
 Pass me them params In my previous job, writing scripts to automate some of the repetitive tasks got me back into the programming route which eventually led me to consider a career shift. To be honest, automating tasks was, at least upfront, more hard work than additional straight up keystrokes. And without guarantee that the time invested will return in any quality or amount of savings, especially for smaller tasks, it was a day&amp;rsquo;s work worth of risk.</description>
