      <description>This solution turned out much longer and even more complicated than I had hoped it would. My solutions for previous days involved pipelines of Enum functions and I purposely avoided going that route as they looked less intelligible with every additional line of anonymous iteration. I had hoped writing around &amp;ldquo;names&amp;rdquo; ala OOP would lend to a shorter and far more readable code. BurntSushi&amp;rsquo;s elegant implementation in Rust seemed ideal. However, the clarity of having names to code around quickly diluted with writing custom type boilerplate and this also due to Elixir having no actual types.</description>

      <description>Explicit is better than implicit.
Zen of Python
 Pass me them params In my previous job, writing scripts to automate some of the repetitive tasks got me back into the programming route which eventually led me to consider a career shift. To be honest, automating tasks was, at least upfront, more hard work than additional straight up keystrokes. And without guarantee that the time invested will return in any quality or amount of savings, especially for smaller tasks, it was a day&amp;rsquo;s work worth of risk.</description>

      <description>This website is a personal homepage.
The site is built with Hugoâ€”a static site generator made with Go. The website source code is available on GitHub. It uses the cocoa theme. The posts are written in Markdown.
The primary font face is Open Sans and the monospace font face is Ubuntu Mono. The social icons are from the Ionicons font set. CSS classes for code syntax highlighting are inserted during compile-time by Hugo using Pygments.</description>
