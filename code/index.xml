      <description>This solution turned out much longer and even more complicated than I had hoped it would. My solutions for previous days involved pipelines of Enum functions and I purposely avoided going that route as they looked less intelligible with every additional line of anonymous iteration. I had hoped writing around &amp;ldquo;names&amp;rdquo; ala OOP would lend to a shorter and far more readable code. BurntSushi&amp;rsquo;s elegant implementation in Rust seemed ideal. However, the clarity of having names to code around quickly diluted with writing custom type boilerplate and this also due to Elixir having no actual types.</description>
